## UTP Intelligent Systems Project

==============================


## Neural Network Training
This project demonstrates how to train a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras on a dataset related to birds sounds and population data. The dataset is read from a CSV file, preprocessed, and then used to train a simple neural network model.

## Country Population from 1960 to 2022
This project demonstrates how to analyze and predict population data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The dataset contains population data for various countries from 1960 to 2022.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Google Colab (for accessing Google Drive)
- Jupyter and Jupyter Notebook for local env instead of Google Colab

### Use requirements file to install dependencies
```sh
python3 - m venv venv
source venv/bin/active
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Output
The training process will output the loss and accuracy for each epoch, showing the model's performance on both the training and validation sets.
